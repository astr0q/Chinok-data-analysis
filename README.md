# Chinook SQL Exercises

This repository contains SQL queries and practice tasks using the [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), a sample database that models a digital media store.

The goal of this project is to strengthen SQL skills by working with realistic business-style queries, including joins, aggregations, grouping, filtering, and analytical reporting.

## üìù Example Queries

1. **Top 5 customers by number of invoices**

   * Uses `JOIN`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` to identify the most frequent buyers.

2. **Customers who never purchased anything**

   * Uses `LEFT JOIN` with `WHERE ... IS NULL` to detect inactive customers.

3. **Most popular track by sales**

   * Aggregates `InvoiceLine` data with `SUM` and joins with `Track`, `Genre`, and `MediaType`.

4. **Monthly revenue trend**

   * Groups invoices by month using `DATE_FORMAT` and calculates total revenue over time.

5. **Top artists by catalog size**

   * Counts tracks per artist to find who has the largest music catalog.
